        <p>The sweet-faced, lovable Labrador Retriever is America's most popular dog breed. Labs are friendly, 
            outgoing, and high-spirited companions who have more than enough affection to go around for a family 
            looking for a medium-to-large dog. The sturdy, well-balanced Labrador Retriever can, depending on the
            sex, stand from 21.5 to 24.5 inches at the shoulder and weigh between 55 to 80 pounds. The dense, hard 
            coat comes in yellow, black, and a luscious chocolate. The head is wide, the eyes glimmer with kindliness, 
            and the thick, tapering 'otter tail'¬ù seems to be forever signaling the breed's innate eagerness. Labs are
             famously friendly. They are companionable housemates who bond with the whole family, and they socialize 
             well with neighbor dogs and humans alike. But don't mistake his easygoing personality for low energy: The Lab is an enthusiastic athlete that 
            requires lots of exercise, like swimming and marathon games of fetch, to keep physically and mentally fit.</p>
