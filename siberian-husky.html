        <p>The Siberian Husky dog breed has a beautiful, thick coat that comes in a multitude of colors and markings.
             Their blue or multi-colored eyes and striking facial masks only add to the appeal of
              this breed, which originated in <span>Siberia.</span>
            It is easy to see why many are drawn to the Siberian’s wolf-like looks, but beware 
            because this athletic, intelligent dog can act independently and challenge first-time dog parents. 
            Huskies also put the “H” in Houdini and need a yard with a high fence that 
            goes all the way into the ground to prevent escapes. 
            Giving your Husky enough exercise may prove easier said than done; though,
             it’ll reduce boredom and unwanted behaviors, like escape attempts.</p>
